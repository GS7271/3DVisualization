# 3DVisualization
MSDS6390 Final
This 3D Visualization developed in processing takes the US Trade in goods by Country (Imports and Exports) from:
https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/index.html
and the GDP of each of those countries from:
https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ny.gdp.mktp.cd
Multidimensional data is visualized in a 3 dimensional space where the size of the sphere is proportional to the GDP and the lines connecting it to the US (core center) are proportional to the import / export flows
